/* 

***Basic Gameplay***
My project will be a "choose your own adventure" style text-based game. 
Players will have the choice to select a character class and set their character name
Players will make choices on how to navigate an underground labyrinth, ocasionally fighting monsters. 
Players' choices will actively affect the outcome of the game.
If a player dies, the game will start over from the beginning.
