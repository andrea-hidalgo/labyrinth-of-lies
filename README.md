#### Development Plans

##### Initial Plan
I want to write the game in a way that allows me to easily expand the storyline if needed, without having to modify a huge if/else tree. The key to this would be creating a Scenario class that will update the DOM elements according to the particular story and options that the player has to make. Clicking a button in the browser will then run a function that pulls up the next scenario. 

#### MVP

MVP ONE
* Start screen
  * Player can select start button to start game
* Play screen
  * Player can see story and make choices
  * Player can fight monsters
  * Display player stats

MVP TWO
* Create additional setup screens
  * Player can input their name
  * Player can select a class to play as, each class has different stats
* Longer storyline
* Display monster pictures


#### Stretch goals

* Expand the storyline
* Introduce luck element, make players roll a virtual die to determine the outcome.
