#### Development Plans

##### Initial Plan
I want to write the game in a way that allows me to easily expand the storyline if needed, without having to modify a huge if/else tree. The key to this would be creating a Scenario class that will update the DOM elements according to the particular story and options that the player has to make. Clicking a button in the browser will then run a function that pulls up the next scenario.
